A simple webpage description of Nairobi City.

Index Page:

- Changed background color to a bage so it can be soothing to the eye and the text to pop as a dark bold color, also that is why i changed the text to black

- Alligned the title, logo, and menu to be centered and to be consistent in both pages

- made the image smaller so it can have an equivelent focus to the text and on thing wouldnt be noticed more than the other. added more text to make sure the page doesnt seem empty

-changed the color scheme of the title and the navigation colors to match the flag in a way and to show the differences without doing too much
